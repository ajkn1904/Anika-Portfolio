                    <p>
                        Hello! This is Anika who likes to create thing that live on the internet. My passion in web development started back in the first of 2022 when I was doing my 'Database Management project' in purpose of my academic education. That project taught me a lot about HTML & CSS! Though it was done using  PHP & MySQL, but now I'm very interested in doing projects using MERN. 
                    </p>

                    <div className='my-10'>
                        Here are the few technologies Iâ€™ve been working now-a-days:

                        <div className='mx-16 my-3 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg::grid-cols-2 gap-3 font-bold text-[#3b143ed7]'>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                            <li>React.js</li>
